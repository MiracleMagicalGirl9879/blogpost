            <p class="paragraph">Welcome to my blog post website. This is where I post content all about the things that I do and watch. This also shows a lot of my actual personality inside my comfort zone. It could also help on knowing me better at some point. <br>
            I like making a website like this since I get to try and become creative with some stuff. It contains games references, my love towards my pet and some of my craftsmanship. This feels a bit boring to read in my opinion so watch this vocaloid editing I did using my utauloid software that took me hours just to download.</p>
